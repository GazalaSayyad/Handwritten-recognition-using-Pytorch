# Handwritten-recognition-using-Pytorch
 Build a digit classifier by training a neural network on MNIST data-set.


MNIST Dataset
The dataset contains 60,000 Handwritten digits as training samples and 10,000 Test samples, which means each digit occurs 6000 times in the training set and 1000 times in the testing set. (approximately).
Each image is Size Normalized and Centered
Each image is 28 X 28 Pixel with 0-255 Gray Scale Value.
That means each image is represented as 784 (28 X28) dimension vector where each value is in the range 0- 255.
